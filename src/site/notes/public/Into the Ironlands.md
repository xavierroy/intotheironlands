# Welcome to the Ironlands

> I am new to playing TTRPGs(Tabletop Role Playing Games) and playing Solo RPGs seemed a good way to get into TTRPGs.

[[the-ironlands.png|The Ironlands]] is the world where the [Ironsworn RPG](ironswornrpg.com) takes place. Ironsworn is a free TTRPG by  [Shawn Tomkin](https://twitter.com/ShawnTomkin). It is available for free on the website. 

As a fan of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I am using it to document my gameplays and the narrative.

My first campaign is called the [[campaigns/Flintales/The Tales of Flint\|The Tales of Flint]]. I'm approaching it as an exercise in building my narrative and storytelling skills. I'll separate the narrative from the mechanical game play but I will try to tie them together so that they makes sense as a play report.
