### Previous Session Recap

We created Flint, an aspiring villager from Ravenhill, an isolated village in the Havens.

# # Session 00.2: Swearing Vows
> session-summary:: creating iron vows

### Background Vow
What's Flint's Background Vow? 

Let's roll for an action and theme.

> [!oracle] Oracle 1: Action
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: 28
>>Result: *Investigate*

> [!oracle] Oracle 2: Theme
>> [!roll] 
>> Dice Roll: 77
>> Result: *Problem*

This is a great rollðŸ˜². What kind of problem is Flint investigating? We've established that Ravenhill has an incomptent leadership. I'm making the overseer Flint's dad to bring in some drama. So Flint's dad has suddenly been making decisions that seem odd. Flint wonders why. This could be his background vow.

> [!vow] Background Vow
> I will... (to be filled in later on)

I am leaving this vow for later. Let's discover this as we play.

### Inciting Vow 

So now for an inciting incident, let's consult the oracles again.

> [!oracle] Oracle 1: Action
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: 17
>>Result: *Assault*

> [!oracle] Oracle 2: Theme
>> [!roll] 
>> Dice Roll: 98
>> Result: *Home*


Assault and Home...

What if Flint's home is attacked by someone? Would that suffice as an inciting incident for Flint to start off on his journey.

I think I will start off the [[campaigns/Flintales/story/001 - The Vow\|narrative]] *in media res*...

#### Swear an Iron Vow

When **you swear upon iron to complete a quest**, write your vow and give the quest a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you make this vow to a person or community with whom you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next ([Ask the Oracle](#Ask-the-Oracle) if unsure). Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you face a significant obstacle before you can begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way ([Ask the Oracle](#Ask-the-Oracle) if unsure), and choose one.

* You press on: Suffer -2 momentum, and do what you must to overcome this obstacle.
* You give up: [Forsake Your Vow](#Forsake-Your-Vow).
