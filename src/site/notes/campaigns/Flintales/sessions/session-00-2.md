### Previous Session Recap

We created Flint, an aspiring villager from Ravenhill, an isolated village in the Havens.

# # Session 00.2: Swearing Vows
> session-summary:: creating iron vows

### Background Vow
What's Flint's Background Vow? 

Let's roll for an action and theme.

> [!oracle] Oracle 1: Action
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: 28
>>Result: *Investigate*

> [!oracle] Oracle 2: Theme
>> [!roll] 
>> Dice Roll: 77
>> Result: *Problem*

This is a great rollðŸ˜². What kind of problem is Flint investigating? We've established that Ravenhill has an incomptent leadership. I'm making the overseer Flint's dad to bring in some drama. So Flint's dad has suddenly been making decisions that seem odd. Flint wonders why. This could be his background vow.

> [!vow] Background Vow
> I will... (to be filled in later on)

I am leaving this vow for later. Let's discover this as we play.

### Inciting Vow 

So now for an inciting incident, let's consult the oracles again.

> [!oracle] Oracle 1: Action
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: 17
>>Result: *Assault*

> [!oracle] Oracle 2: Theme
>> [!roll] 
>> Dice Roll: 98
>> Result: *Home*


Assault and Home...

What if Flint's home is attacked by someone? Would that suffice as an inciting incident for Flint to start off on his journey.

I think I will start off the [[campaigns/Flintales/story/001 - The Vow\|narrative]] *in media res*...
