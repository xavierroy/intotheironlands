# Session 00.1: Character Generation

> session-summary:: Character creation

---
This is my first attempt at an actual play report - in fact this would be my first Ironsworn game. I'm planning to make the maximum usage of oracles for moving the narrative.

### Campaign Name
First off, we need a campign name. I used the [Random Adventure Title Generator](https://loottheroom.uk/random-adventure-title-generator)  to generate a random campaign name. A couple of refreshes later, ***Night's Lords*** seemed to jump out to me.

- [x] Start a campaign and give it a name: ~~Night's Lords~~, ==Tales of Flint==

2022-11-13 - I renamed this to **Tales of Flint** as I felt this was more of Flints's tales. I'm reserving Night's Lords for a future campaign.

### Character Generation

I am planning to build up my character as the game progresses. I'm planning to start off by creating a character.

>[!oracle] Oracle 13: Ironlander Names
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **90** 
> Result:  *Flint*


Flint seems a cool name. I want him to have cool adventures. 

- [x] Give your character a name: **Flint**

So what's Flint's character like? Let's roll for it.

>[!oracle] Oracle 10: Character Role 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **31** 
> Result: *Mystic*

So Flint could be a mystical person! Now this would mean that the Ironlands supports magic. So I'm choosing a [[rules/World#Mysticism\|Mysticism Truth]].

> Some still find comfort in the old ways. They call on mystics to divine the fortune of their newborn, or ask them to perform rituals to invoke a bountiful harvest. Others act out of fear against those who they suspect of having power. However, most folk believe true magic—if it ever existed—is lost to us now. 

Next up, I want to know what would a goal for Flint. This could also form a basis for his background vow. Let's roll for a character goal.
>[!oracle] Oracle 11: Character Goal 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **29** 
> Result: *Find a person*

Hmm. Flint seems to be searching for someone? Is it a family member or someone else? Since we threw up *Mystic* in our character role, I am kind of thinking of making Flint a wannabe apprentice. That could lead to him searching for a mentor or a teacher. {Skywalker-Yoda -vibe?}

Let's find out more about Flint with more rolls.

>[!oracle] Oracle 12: Character Descriptor 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Rolls: **58** & **95**
> Result: *Athletic* & *Incompetent*
 
This is an interesting combination. Could Flint be a bumbling brute? Since the oracles are meant to be interpreted to suit the narrative. I am thinking of building Flint as an apprentice who hasn't mastered anything yet inspite of his current efforts becuase he is still not competent enough. Flint could be a very quick runner. Maybe he was the best runner in his village. Or he could be the brawniest guy in the village. That would also be an interesting juxtaposition.

> Flint is a muscular wannabe shaman.

Let's build up Flint's backstory with some more information.

>[!oracle] Oracle 3: Region 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **58** 
> Result: *Havens*

>[!oracle] Oracle 6: Location Description 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **100** 
> Result: *Isolated* 

>[!oracle] Oracle 8: Quick Settlement Name Generator 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Rolls: **14** & **52** 
> Result: *Raven* & *-hill* = *Ravenhill*

>[!oracle] Oracle 9: Settlement Trouble 
>>[!roll]
>>Dice Roll: **67** 
> Result: *Incompetent Leadership*

Flint comes from [[almanac/places/Ravenhill\|Ravenhill]], an isolated village in the Havens. The overseer is incompetent. 

### Stats

Since we know Flint is athletic, I'm going to give him a *3* for **Iron** and *2* for **Edge**. Since he is incompetent, I'm giving a *1* each for **Wits** and **Shadow**, leaving a *2* for **Heart**.

| Stat   | Value  | Roll         |
| ------ | -----  | -------------|
| **EDGE** | 2 | `dice: 1d6+2` | 
| **HEART**|  2 | `dice: 1d6+2` |
|**IRON**| 3 | `dice: 1d6+3`  |
|**SHADOW**| 1  | `dice: 1d6+1` 
| **WITS**| 1 | `dice: 1d6+1` |

#### Swear an Iron Vow

When **you swear upon iron to complete a quest**, write your vow and give the quest a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you make this vow to a person or community with whom you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next ([Ask the Oracle](#Ask-the-Oracle) if unsure). Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you face a significant obstacle before you can begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way ([Ask the Oracle](#Ask-the-Oracle) if unsure), and choose one.

* You press on: Suffer -2 momentum, and do what you must to overcome this obstacle.
* You give up: [Forsake Your Vow](#Forsake-Your-Vow).
