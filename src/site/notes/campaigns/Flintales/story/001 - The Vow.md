# Episode 01: The Vow


> *'Nothing good ever happens in Ravenhill.'*

Of late, this statement has become the standard form of greeting between Raveners. 

Since the village of Ravenhill was formed, people had always blamed the overseer for their troubles. But recently, the muttering of the villagers has become more louder and more common.

One of the reasons was Flint's dad, the overseer of Ravenhill.

[[campaigns/Flintales/characters/Flint\|Flint]] cringed everytime he heard someone say that statement. He did not understand some of the decisions that Da had taken recently. Just last week, he ordered that from this week onwards, everyone will be working one extra turn of the pebble-clock.  He decreed since the sun sets later in summar, there is sunlight available for people to work in the fields before their supper. So everyone is unhappy at this extra hour of work. 

*Flint, did you hear about the man who came in last night?* 

Flint replied, *"Yes, I did, Vigo"*. 

As they made their way from the field where they had been practising with staffs, the pair noticed that the villagers were giving them strange looks.

*Just ignore them. They are probably angry at your dad over the extra hour of work.
Do you think he will ask us to work an hour less in ventur?*

*Should I ask him at dinner tonight? Though I doubt he will even listen to me.
Especially after I told him my wish.*

*Yeah, I told you your dad would not like your idea of becoming a shaman. He wants you to be the next overseer.*

*Bah! I don't want to be stuck in this village. I want to be like Alban the White Wizard.*

*Ha ha, you as one of those shamans. You are a tarfur, not a gandr.*

*Flint, Flint* came a cry behind the pair.

Turning around, they saw Flint's sister Mona running towards them.

*Mona, what's the matter?*

*Come quickly, something's wrong with Ma.* 

*Ma! what happened?*

*I don't know. She was talking with someone outside the house and then suddenly I heard her cry out in pain. I rushed out of the house and she was lying there unconscious.*

*I did not know what to do. I couldn't find Da. So I set out to find you.*

The trio rushed to Flint's home. They arrive and rush inside to see Flint's mother lying in bed with Flint's dad standing next to her. He looks anguished and yet at the same time frightened.

As Flint entered, he saw his dad put something in his pocket as soon as he saw Flint. He glanced at Flint and at his daughter before he left the room.

Incensed, Flint starts towards his dad but Mona pulls him back towards their unconscious mother.

*Flint, let it go. I forgot to tell you something. The man who was speaking with Ma...*

*Who is he and where is he?*, Flint interjected.

*He is missing but I think he was the one who came in last night and was looking to talk to Da. I have seen him arguing with Da earlier today. Nekun said he saw a man leaving the village before I found you. I think it must be him.* 
 
*But what happened to Ma?*

*I'll find that out once you clear the room*, they heard a voice behind them.

It was Ishana, the village volva.  

As he trudged past her, Flint gestured Mona to stay with their mother.

Flint then went to find his father and could not find him. 

As he sat on the steps of the house at the back, he could hear people gathering in front of their house and he plays with the ring on his hand. It was a gift from Da on the day he survived 14 winters. Da made a special ceremony of giving that ring. 

The ring was of the metal they called black-iron. Some say it was from the ships that brought them from the old world. Others say it came from the stars. Some others claim that the metal was from the chains their forefathers wore in the old world. Whichever story you believe, the fact everyone agrees on is that the iron is precious and has some strange powers. Any vow sworn by touching a piece of iron becomes a binding one and one swore on this black-iron was even more powerful and binding than the ones sworn on ordinary iron.

Hearing a noise behind him, he turned to see Mona approaching with a distraught look.

*Flint, she has been poisoned. Ishana says that this poison is strange to her.*

*Can't she cure Ma?*

*No, she said this poison requires some potions that she does not possess. She mentioned that the volva at Greenrock had that potion.*

I'll go there and will get the potion. Touching the ring and bringing his hand to his breast, Flint said, *==I swear an Iron Vow to save Ma from this affliction==*.
